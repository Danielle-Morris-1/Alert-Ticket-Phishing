## üîç Ticket Details

An alert was generated after a user opened a malicious file from a **phishing email**. Key indicators included:

1.  **Header Analysis:** I examined the sender's email address (`76tguy6hh6tgftrt7tg.su`) and compared it against the sender name ("Clyde West") and alias ("Def Communications"). The discrepancies I noted were indicative of phishing.
2.  **Content Review:** I analyzed the email body, identifying suspicious elements such as grammatical errors and an unusual subject line ("Infrastructure Engineer role").
3.  **Attachment Scrutiny:** I noted the presence of a password-protected executable attachment (`bfsvc.exe`), recognizing this as a common tactic used to evade initial security scans.
4.  **Threat Intelligence Verification:** I utilized available threat intelligence (implicitly through the alert flagging the file hash) to confirm the malicious nature of the attached file. The file hash's prior identification as malicious strongly suggested a known threat.
5.  **Malware Identification:** Further investigation revealed the file hash was associated with "Flagpro" malware, a tool reportedly used by the advanced persistent threat (APT) group **BlackTech**, indicating a potentially sophisticated attack.
